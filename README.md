AspNet.Identity.Cassandra
=========================
The initially release is now complete.  Please create an issue (or pull request) for any problems you find with the code and I will work through them as quickly as possible.  

To install simply run "Install-Package AspNet.Identity.Cassandra" from the package manager.  
Once installed you will need to make some minor modification to the AccountController.

For a simple example please refer to the example in the source code.
